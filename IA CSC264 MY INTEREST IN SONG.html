<b>PART TIME MUSICIANS</b>
<br>
<br>
Part Time Musicians is a young indie folk band with six members. They are, for lack of a more marketable term, a group that specialises in boys and girls singing in harmony. And the pleasure they take from it is evident. We are aware of that as well. They're also self-described as "not much of a rock band," but what they want to do is do something to demonstrate their appreciation for the music they've loved since boyhood. Their self-titled debut album received a lot of positive feedback, with reviewers praising their improved lyrics and vocal harmonies.
<br>
<br>
In June 2013, the five faces' debut single "Vacation Time" reached number one on Fat Radio's Top 40 chart (Thailand). the five personalities "Would You Mind?" is Part Time Musicians' second single, which was released shortly. On violin is Chawalit Saowapakpongchai of Chladni Chandi, as well as Noparuj Satjawan, a great sitar player. This song is a fun, lively melody with enough unique elements to keep it from being too cutesy while still representing the exciting-dark side of the instrument they created and included in the song.
<br>
<br>
Their music was influenced by bands they admired, such as Nick Drake, Bob Dylan, Fleet Foxes, Mumford and Sons, until some side-inspirations of Pink Floyd guitar riffs and psychedelic music emerged.
<br>
<br>
In addition, they draw influences from folk music, individual pop, and choral music, as well as their English lyrics. In October, not long after the success of their second song, the band discovered the final piece of the puzzle in the form of a violinist for their latest hit "The Haunted House." The passionate and beautiful song features small gospelish voices and mind-blowing guitar solos, and it's merged with indie-folk. To create a sense of hope and solitude, the words are primarily surrounded by empty space. Part Time Musicians have clearly relied on the eternal power of music throughout their careers. Critics recognised they were tremendously talented in the songwriting and harmony areas when they first started making and performing music.  From the beginning, it was evident that they would succeed. And they succeeded.
<br>
<br>
They just released "The Only One" for Valentine's Day in 2015. The voices are overly charming, and the violin melodies will blow your mind and transport you back to your grandparents' period. After "The Haunted House," which drew you to tears with its melancholy and heartbreaking lyrics, this is another happy and cosy track. But that's all over now, till their next adventure begins.

<b>PLASTIC PLASTIC</b>
<br>
<br>
Plastic Plastic (พลาสติก พลาสติก) is a Bangkok Syn Pop duo consisting of a vocalist and a keyboard player, “Pleng”” (Tongta Jitdee) and a guitarist, “Pong”” (Pokpong Jitdee). With their syn-pop music type, it created a new music scene among Thai teenagers for over the past few years.
<br>
<br>
In 2016, Plastic Plastic released a debut album, STAY AT HOME, which is an electronic-acoustic genre consisting of 9 songs. Most of the songs are composed in English. The album received such an enormous positive feedback, creating Plastic Plastic to be the representative of the new generation bands as well as the new music icon for Thai teenagers.
<br>
<br>
Thereafter, they separately worked on their own projects. Pong has gathered with his friend to create a quintet tropical pop band, “Gym and Swim.” The band created a great phenomenon of touring around Asia including South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. It was one of the Top 5 Best Southeast Asian bands ranked by a well-known British style magazine, Dazed. For Pleng, she got a chance to work with Scrubb, an all-time hit band in Thailand. Both of them also collaborate with Ter Nawapol, a talented film director to produce a soundtrack for the movie, “Girl Don’t Cry”.
<br>
<br>
Recently in 2018, Plastic Plastic comes back with their new album ready to be released under the music label, What The Duck. The new album will bring more contemporary vibes due to their syn pop type of music combining with the use of the synthesizer, recorder, and natural artificial sounds. The new album consists of 7 songs including five songs composed in English and two in Thai.

<b>CUCO</b>
<br>
<br>
Omar Banos (born June 26, 1998), known professionally as Cuco, is a Mexican American (Chicano) singer-songwriter and record producer from Hawthorne, California. His fame escalated after releasing "Lo Que Siento" (2017), which attracted over 191 million streams on Spotify alone. Cuco self-released his first two EPs, Wannabewithu (2016) and Songs4u (2017) after graduating from Hawthorne High School. In 2019, he released his first studio album Para Mi with Interscope Records. The time between Para Mí and now, which fell during the isolating lockdown of the pandemic, found Cuco facing himself—the good, the bad, and the ugly. Determined to become a healthier version of himself, he had to create a safer world to reside in—starting from within. For the recording of Fantasy Gateway, Cuco planted himself in his parents’ native land of Mexico, specifically Mexico City, to explore all his selves—song by song. His music has gained approximately 290.6 million streams according to Nielsen Music.

<b>ADAN DIAZ</b>
<br>
<br>
Adan Diaz is a 17-year-old Mexican-American singer and guitarist based outside Chicago. When the pandemic hit and he was confined to his bedroom, Adan found solace in a cracked version of Ableton Live. He recorded new music everyday. He tried out new ways of singing, sometimes in Spanish and other times in English depending on how he was feeling. Slowly but surely he discovered a new vocabulary to communicate the torrent of confusion, surprise, boredom, anger, and lovesickness he's felt during this particularly bizarre moment in human history.
